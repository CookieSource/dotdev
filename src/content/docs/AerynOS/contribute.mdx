## Financial contributions to AerynOS

AerynOS is an independent effort run by a handful of volunteers. The team is currently targeting an income of 500€ per month to cover:

1. Infrastructure and project costs
2. Repayment to project stakeholders for initial project seed funding
3. Build up a buffer for unexpected costs and future initiatives.

We currently accept donations via [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/aerynos).
