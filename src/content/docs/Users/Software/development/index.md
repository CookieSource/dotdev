# Development

AerynOS provides a stable foundation for creating, testing, and deploying applications.

You can install tools such as text editors, programming languages, compilers, and version control systems. AerynOS also supports containerization and virtualization technologies.

## Getting started

If you want to compile and develop software using AerynOS, we recommend installing the `system.devel` component.

```bash
sudo moss install -c system.devel
```

The `system.devel` component installs libraries and packages for software development, such as `clang`, `gcc`, and `make`.
