AerynOS now offers [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) as a Desktop Environment though it is currently considered beta status. You can track the progress of identifying and resolving Plasma related issues on [Github](https://github.com/AerynOS/recipes/issues/952).

### Installing Plasma on an existing AerynOS install

If you are already using GNOME, you are able to install KDE Plasma side by side and select which Desktop Environment to use in `GDM` at login. You do this by installing one of three package sets:

```bash
sudo moss install pkgset-aeryn-plasma-minimal
sudo moss install pkgset-aeryn-plasma-recommended
sudo moss install pkgset-aeryn-plasma-full
```

The names are fairly self explanatory:
* Minimal: The minimum number of packages required for a Plasma desktop session
* Recommended: The minimal Plasma desktop session plus additional recommended applications
* Full: The recommended Plasma desktop session plus all available KDE applications


### Controlling the display manager

If you've installed Plasma over the top of a GNOME install, you can still log into your Plasma session from `gdm`. You can also safely remove `gdm` and have either `sddm` or `plasma-login-manager` take over. Note: GNOME Shell still expects `gdm` for full functionality.

#### Installing either sddm or plasma-login-manager

```bash
sudo moss install sddm
```

or

```bash
sudo moss install plasma-login-manager
```

#### Removing gdm
If you wish to remove `gdm`, you would use the following command:

```bash
sudo moss remove gdm
```
