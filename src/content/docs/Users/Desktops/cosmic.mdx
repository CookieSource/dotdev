The [COSMIC Desktop](https://system76.com/cosmic) from [System76](https://system76.org) is a highly popular choice with AerynOS users. COSMIC is notable for being written in Rust and using a modern multiprocess architecture, while being Wayland-only. For many, this makes AerynOS and COSMIC an ideal partnership.

### Installing COSMIC on AerynOS

AerynOS currently only offers one iso with a GNOME live environment. However, `lichen` is a net based installer that allows users to select their Desktop Environment at install time. As such, you can install AerynOS COSMIC edition directly from the GNOME based AerynOS installer iso.

If you are already using GNOME, you are able to install Cosmic Desktop side by side and select which Desktop Environment to use in `GDM` at login. You do this by installing one of three package sets:

```bash
sudo moss install pkgset-aeryn-cosmic-minimal
sudo moss install pkgset-aeryn-cosmic-recommended
sudo moss install pkgset-aeryn-cosmic-full
```
The names are fairly self explanatory:
* Minimal: The minimum number of packages required for a Cosmic Desktop session
* Recommended: The minimal Cosmic Desktop session plus additional recommended applications
* Full: The recommended Cosmic Dekstop session plus additional optional applications

### Controlling the display manager

If you've installed COSMIC over the top of a GNOME install, you can still log into your COSMIC session from `gdm`. You can also safely remove `gdm` and have `cosmic-greeter` take over. Note: GNOME Shell still expects `gdm` for full functionality.

#### Installing cosmic-greeter

```bash
sudo moss install cosmic-greeter
```

#### Removing gdm
If you wish to remove `gdm`, you would use the following command:

```bash
sudo moss remove gdm
```
