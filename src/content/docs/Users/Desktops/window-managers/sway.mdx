[Sway](https://swaywm.org/) is a dynamic tiling window manager designed as a drop-in replacement for i3, but built for Wayland. It offers a lightweight workflow that is well suited to machines where users prefer keyboard driven navigation over graphical shell integrations.

### Installing Sway on AerynOS

Sway is currently packaged as a single minimal session that you can add to any existing AerynOS installation. Install the package set with `moss`:

```bash
sudo moss install pkgset-aeryn-sway-minimal
sudo moss install branding-aeryn-sway
```

After installation you can select the Sway session from your display manager, or start it directly from a TTY with `exec sway`.
