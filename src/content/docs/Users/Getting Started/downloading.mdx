## Downloading the ISO

1. Visit the [AerynOS download page](https://download.aerynos.com).
2. Look for the latest release available for download, the official ISO files are named `AerynOS-<version>-<desktop>-<architecture>.iso`.

  <Aside>
  There may be multiple versions available with different desktop environments denoted by `AerynOS-<version>-<desktop>-<architecture>.iso` where `<desktop>` is the desktop environment.

3. Click on the download link to start downloading the ISO file and assiocated checksums denoted by `AerynOS-<version>-<desktop>-<architecture>.iso.sha256sum`.

Once the download is complete, you can proceed with creating a bootable USB drive or burning the ISO to a DVD to install AerynOS on your machine.

## Verifying the Checksums

Before creating a bootable USB drive or burning the ISO to a DVD, it's important to verify the checksums to ensure the integrity of the downloaded ISO file.

<Aside type="caution">
  Using the ISO file without verifying the checksums can lead to boot failures, installation issues, and potential security risks.

### Linux

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the ISO file is located along with the checksums.

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
```

2. Run the following command to verify the checksums:

```bash

sha256sum -c <checksum_file>
```
You should see a message indicating that the checksums match if the ISO file is valid.

```bash
AerynOS-2025.03-GNOME-x86_64.iso: OK
```

If the checksums do not match, download the ISO file again and repeat the verification process.

### Windows

1. Open a Command Prompt window and navigate to the directory where the ISO file is located along with the checksums.

```cmd
cd C:\Users\<username>\Downloads
```

2. Run the following command to verify the checksums:

```cmd
certutil -hashfile aerynos-<version>.iso SHA256
```

This will give you the checksum of the file, compare this to the checksum found inside the checksum file.
