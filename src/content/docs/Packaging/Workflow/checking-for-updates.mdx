## Use `ent` to check for package updates

This guide will walk you through the process using `ent`, a tool built by the AerynOS team to check for package updates. `ent` checks recipes against upstream sources to determine whether updates are available.

`ent` is not installed on your system by default. To install `ent` using `moss`, use the following command:

```bash
sudo moss install ent
```
### How `ent` works

`ent` scans the current directory and all subdirectories beneath it. It inspects each recipe `monitoring.yaml` file and compares the referenced `stone.yaml` recipe upstreams to determine whether newer versions are available.

Because `ent` operates relative to the directory in which it is executed, you can control the scope of the update check by choosing where to run the command within the recipes repository.

### Running update checks

To check for updates across all recipes, run the following command from the root of the recipes repository:

```bash
gotoaosrepo
ent check updates
```

You can also run this command from more specific locations:

* **Repository root**
  Checks all recipes in the repository.

* **Letter directory (for example, `f/`)**
  Checks only recipes whose names start with that letter.

* **Specific recipe directory (for example, `f/firefox/`)**
  Checks only that single recipe.

For example, running the command from `f/firefox/` will check only the Firefox recipe for available updates.

<Aside type="note" title="What is ent?">
    `ent` queries an upstream site for package release info *every time you run it*. Please be mindful of not running it gratuitously so as to remain a good ecosystem citizen.
