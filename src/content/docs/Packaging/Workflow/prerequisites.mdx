To set up a AerynOS system to be able to build package recipes, a few prerequisites need to be
installed, and a new directory for storing local build artifacts needs to be set up.


## Installing the `build-essential` package

We maintain a `build-essential` metapackage that should contain the basics for getting started
with packaging on AerynOS.

```bash
sudo moss sync -u
sudo moss it build-essential
```


## Activating the AerynOS helper scripts

The easiest way to create a local repository is to use the helper script distributed with the
AerynOS recipe repository in the `tools/` directory.

Start by cloning the recipes/ git repository:

```bash
mkdir -pv repos/aerynos/
pushd repos/aerynos
git clone https://github.com/AerynOS/recipes
```

After the recipes/ git repository has been cloned, symlink helpers.bash into `~/.bashrcd.d/`:

```bash
popd
mkdir -pv ~/.bashrc.d/
ln -sv ~/repos/aerynos/recipes/tools/helpers.bash ~/.bashrc.d/90-aerynos-helpers.bash
```

Finally, execute the following in a new terminal tab:

```bash
cd ~
gotoaosrepo
```

If the helpers script has been correctly loaded, the `gotoaosrepo` command should switch to
the directory containing the recipes/ git repository clone.


### Setting up git hooks and linters

The `just` command runner should have been installed as part of `build-essential`.

Run the following:

```bash
gotoaosrepo
just init
```

This will setup git hooks that will lint for the most common packaging errors upon git commit, as well as fill out commit message templates for you to edit as appropriate.


### Setting up `git diff` auto-conversion of `manifest.*.bin` files

This will make it so you can view `git diff` output for binary `manifest.*.bin` files in both `git diff` and `git log -p .` invocations.

Edit the recipe repo `.git/config` file to contain the following below the `[core]` section:

```ini
[diff "moss"]
    textconv = moss inspect
    binary = true
```

The recipe repo already contains the `.gitattributes` file that sets up the `moss` diff filter referenced here.

### Setting up the `git gone` alias

This will make it so that executing `git gone` will remove any local branches that no longer exist upstream.

Edit your `~/.gitconfig` file to contain the following:

```ini
[alias]
    gone = "!f() { git fetch --all --prune; git branch -vv | awk '/: gone]/{print $1}' | xargs git branch -D; }; f"
```


## Adding /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid entries

Since `boulder` uses user-namespaces to set up isolated build roots, it is necessary to set up
a subuid and a subgid file for the relevant users first:

```bash
sudo touch /etc/sub{uid,gid}
sudo usermod --add-subuids 1000000-1065535 --add-subgids 1000000-1065535 root
sudo usermod --add-subuids 1065536-1131071 --add-subgids 1065536-1131071 "$USER"
```

If `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` already exist, adapt the above as appropriate.
